I created a Roman numeral converter, project 2/5 of the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification Course.

You can try it here: https://marccodez.github.io/Roman-numeral-Converter/.

Open up Chrome Developer Tools, call the function convertToRoman() and pass in a number you would like to convert
